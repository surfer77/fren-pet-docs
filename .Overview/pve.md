# Player Vs Environment (PVE)

You can win prizes in different ways by exploring the world, some of them include:

-   Daily Spin The Wheel
    

-   Dice game
    

-   Gatcha machine
    

## Spin The Wheel

Every pet can Spin The Wheel once a day for free (gas) and win points that represent the 2% players share of $FP trading activity.

## Gacha Machine

Every time your pet levels up you get a free Gacha spin.

Gacha spins are where you can win or lose attack or defence points which are crucial for pets' further advancement in the Fren Pet World.

## Lootbox

You can spin the lootbox for $2 each time for a max of 12 times a day per pet, you pick what ultimate upgrade you would like for your pet if you get lucky. 

There 3 options:

1. Improve your attack points
1. Improve your defense points
1. Earn pGOLD

Note that for attack and defense points you have a chance of 1 in 10 to win anything, this will be revised after tests with users to balance game mechanics.

## Training Camp

Training camp allows you to increase your pet's attack or defense by +1 point for each camp level. 
The duration to train increases by 30 minutes for each level. Starting at 30 minutes, then 1 hour, and so on.

To join the first camp, you need 10 bonk wins. Each subsequent camp requires 10 more bonk wins than the last (e.g., second camp needs 20 more wins, third needs 30 more wins).



## Dice

You can join the Dice game and play against other players to win up to 50 $FP per game!

To join the dice costs 10 $FP and the order in which you join (from 1 to 6) decides the dice number you picked for when the dice is rolled.

The dice can be rolled only after 6 players join the game.


**Spin The Wheel, Dice, Lootboxes, and Gacha Machine work with a commit and reveal scheme behind the scenes to ensure fair outcomes on a long enough timeframe.**
