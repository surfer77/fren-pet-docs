You can collect monsters as a ERC1155 NFT if you win the battle.

## How it works

-   Look out for pets on the map and make sure their stats suit you current level so you get decent odds.
    

-   Every 40 wins in battles against other pets, you get a chance to battle a monster in the Fren Pet World.
    

-   The odds of the monster battles are always 50-50, your AP and DP don't matter.
    

-   If you win, you collect that monster as an ERC1155 NFT.
    

-   If you lose, you need to win 2 more battles against players pets for another chance.
    

-   When you win against monsters you get pGOLD, points, and the monster NFT which is rare and limited based on mechanics of the game.
    

-   Monsters will likely be able to be exchanged/traded in the future.

[!IMPORTANT]
While the rest of the in-app games are settled via fair on-chain commit/reveal RNG, advancement in Fren Pet World uses the following on-chain function `winProbability = (attackPoints * 100) / (attackPoints + defensePoints)` , which makes the gatcha machine core engine for advancement in the Fren Pet World.
