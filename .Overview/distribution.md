# $FP

## Fren Pet Rewards System

There is a 4% tax every time someone buys or sells $FP tokens on [UniSwap](https://app.uniswap.org/explore/tokens/base/0xff0c532fdb8cd566ae169c1cb157ff2bdc83e105). Once the smart contract accrues 50 $FP tokens from taxes, they get automatically swapped into ETH and distributed as follows:

-   2% goes to the players of the game as rewards.
    

-   1% goes to the developers of Fren Pet.
    

-   1% gets added back as liquidity provision to support the $FP economy.
    

The player rewards are distributed according to your share of in-game points in relation to the total points of all pets in the game.

**When you claim your points on the app your score resets to 0 and your pet level starts from scratch, strategize accordingly.**

Note: Rewards work by interacting directly with a uniV2 contract, we reserve the right to block any uniV3 pools created as they would harm the players of the game. If you got tokens stuck in a uniV3 pool, contact us to help you.

## In-game usage

All $FP tokens used within the game are 90% burned and 10% sent to referrals.

**Note: The referral system has been removed but if you were an early player that has referrals you will still earn these fees.**

## Burn $FP

All $FP used to buy mushrooms is 100% burned. So far over 25% (or 2.5mill $FP) of the max supply has been burned by players.

## Distribution

100% of the FP tokens were distributed via a baseSwap pool with an initial buy limit of ~$0.80 cents per player, any player could get a maximum of 5000 $FP tokens to mint a pet and play the game

The team didn't pre-receive any tokens, all tokens they own were acquired.
