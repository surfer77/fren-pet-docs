# Stake to Play (S2P)

$FP used for upgrades is fully refunded via a Stake to Play model. All $FP a player chooses to stake is added to a contract that slowly returns it all back (per block) over 30 days. Nothing more, nothing less.

For example, if a player stakes 30 $FP to upgrade their pet, they'll receive 1 $FP a day until they reach 30 days and are fully refunded. Accumulated $FP can be withdrawn at any time.

With this mechanism players know they can keep playing and upgrading for as long as they chose to be part of the game.

## Points

Points players earn along their journey are a direct claim on ETH generated by buys and sells of $FP. [Read more on that here](/Overview/distribution).

Players earn points in a few ways:

-   Staking $FP
    

-   Winning battles in PVP
    

-   Defeating monsters
    

-   Getting lucky on a wheel spin
    

-   Feeding a mushroom (5 points)
