# pGold

## Earn pGold

We created an on-chain in-game coin called $pGOLD to keep track of the shares of each player from the players treasure, based on pet score/points.

A total of 10,000,000 $pGOLD will ever exist.

Players can earn $pGOLD in two ways:

-   Swapping $FP for it in the swap tab
    

-   Defeating monsters in battle
    

## pGOLD Liquidity Providers

Due to the mechanics of pGOLD you can also liquidity provide (LP) your $FP that earns 2% of all trading fees and any pGOLD other players decide to sell into the pool.

Due the entirety of pGOLD supply being backed by an ever growing FP treasury you are always expected to have more FP value when you stop LPing.

There is a 2% swap fee when players buy or sell pGOLD with FP that goes to LPs
