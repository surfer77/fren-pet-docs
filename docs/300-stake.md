# Stake to Play (S2P)

To grow points in-game, players have the possibility to stake $FPs in the "Upgrade" section.

$FP used for upgrades is fully refunded via a Stake to Play model. All $FP a player chooses to stake is added to a contract that slowly returns it all back (per block) over 30 days. Nothing more, nothing less.

For example, if a player stakes 30 $FP to upgrade their pet, they'll receive 1 $FP a day until they reach 30 days and are fully refunded. Accumulated $FP can be withdrawn at any time.

With this mechanism players know they can keep playing and upgrading for as long as they chose to be part of the game.
