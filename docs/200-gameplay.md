# Gameplay


## ü•ö Adopt a pet

Create a pet by adopting (minting) one through the app. 

All pets start with the same score (0 points) and the same stats (10 ATK and 10 DEF).  
When minted, your pet is undevelopped and looks like an egg. It will develop over the course of the next few days to grow into a full grown pet.

You can adopt more than one pet if you desire, and can create subsequent pets against a fee.

## üçÑ Feed your pet

Your pet needs to be fed at least every 3 days. Every time you feed your pet, its "Time Of Death" (TOD) will be resetted to 3 days.

To feed your pet, you need to give it shrooms. You can get shrooms by attacking other players. For every 10 attacks you do, you will unlock 1 shroom.

If you did not unlock any shroom during the 3 days, and need to feed your pet, you can still do it for a cost of $1.5

If a pet is not fed before the timer goes to 0, the pet will go into [hibernation for 7 days](/gameplay#hibernation).


### Upgrades

Upgrades (staking of $FPs) is another way to grow your pet points. When using an upgrade, ** it has the same effect as feeding a shroom and will reset the TOD to 3 days.**


## üõû Spin the wheel

Every 24 hours, each pet has the opportunity to "Spin the Wheel", which can get the pet up to 2 000 points. (500 for [free users](/freemium))

## üí™ Train your pet

There are 3 ways to train your pet Attack (ATK) and Defense (DEF) points, which are crucial for pets' further advancement in the Fren Pet World.

#### 1) Gachas 

The first is by getting more points. When your pet grows in points, it will unlock "Gachas", which you can play in order to win up to 4 points in either ATK or DEF.

#### 2) Training Camp

Attacking other players will allow you to unlock time in the Training camp.  

Training camp allows you to increase your pet's attack or defense by +1 point for each camp level. 
The duration to train increases by 30 minutes for each level. Starting at 30 minutes, then 1 hour, and so on.

To join the first camp, you need 10 bonk wins. Each subsequent camp requires 10 more bonk wins than the last (e.g., second camp needs 20 more wins, third needs 30 more wins).

#### 3) Lootboxes

You can spin the lootbox for $2 each time for a max of 12 times a day per pet, you pick what ultimate upgrade you would like for your pet if you get lucky. 

There 2 options:

1. Improve your attack points
1. Improve your defense points

Note that for attack and defense points you have a chance of 1 in 10 to win anything, this will be revised after tests with users to balance game mechanics.


## ‚öîÔ∏è Battle against other players

Every 30 minutes (10 for [pass holders](freemium#pass-holder)), your pet can attack (bonk) a pet that hasn't been bonked for 1 hour. (in a limit of 32 attacks per day)

Your pet ATK will be used against the other pet DEF to determine who is the winner.

The winner will get up to 0.5% of the loser's points (1% if the target is hibernated).

## üëπ Collect Monsters

Pets the more they grow, can start to battle & collect Monsters.

Monsters are NPC that can be found in the [explore](https://frenpet.xyz/explore) section of the game. 

To start fighting monsters, your pet must:

- Attack others pets. You need at least 40 wins vs other players per monster.
- Grow in points (monster 1 necessitate 1000 points, monster 2 necessitate 4500 points, ...).

When battling monsters, pets ALWAYS have a 50% chance of winning. If they do, they get rewarded with an NFT (ERC1155) representing the monster, some points and pGold.  

If the pet loses, it needs 2 more wins against players to be able to battle that monster again.

Once you collected the 10th monsters, you will unlock a Potion that allows you to evolve your pet into another species. Dog, Sheep, Monkey or even Dragon are possible!

## Name your pet

Players can also change the name of their pet by clicking on it and inputing the name they wish to give. The new name will be shown on the leaderboard and when battling.

## ‚≠ê Stars

Stars are given to players that help the game by doing the necessary transaction needed to Hibernate and Kill pets.

For the moment, there is no known utility to stars. Consider them as a trophy.


## üé≤ Dice

If your pet likes to play, it can join the Dice game and play against other players to win up to 1 $FP per game!

To join the dice costs 0.2 $FP and the order in which you join (from 1 to 6) decides the dice number you picked for when the dice is rolled.

The dice can be rolled only after 6 players join the game.


## üí§ Hibernation

If a pet is not fed before the TOD timer goes to 0, the pet will enter a 7 days Hibernation period.

During that period the pet can not do anything except go out of hibernation. It is also weaker, and loses up to 1% of its points when being attacked.

It cost $5.5 to wake a pet up from hibernation.

If a pet is not awoken before the end of the 7 days Hibernation period, the [pet dies](/gameplay#death).

## ü™¶ Death

Once a pet dies, the NFT representing the pet is burnt (deleted).

Any unclaimed [reward](rewards) is automatically transferred to the pet owner at the time of death.

Any staked FPs are transferred to the pet owner at the time of death.

**Spin The Wheel, Dice, Lootboxes, and Gacha Machine work with a commit and reveal scheme behind the scenes to ensure fair outcomes on a long enough timeframe.**
