# $FP

[$FP](https://basescan.org/address/0xff0c532fdb8cd566ae169c1cb157ff2bdc83e105) is the token that is used in-game. 

## In-game usage

Every action with a cost in dollar will automatically buy $FPs and either burn it or add it to the [player's treasure](pgold). That includes feeding, reviving or [monthly pass](freemium#%EF%B8%8F-monthly-pass) buys.

## Burn $FP

All $FP used to buy mushrooms is 100% burned. So far over 25% (or 2.5mill $FP) of the max supply has been burned by players.

## Distribution

100% of the FP tokens were distributed via a baseSwap pool with an initial buy limit of ~$0.80 cents per player, any player could get a maximum of 5000 $FP tokens to mint a pet and play the game

The team didn't pre-receive any tokens, all tokens they own were acquired.
